# HLStockUpdate
I do some data processing for my father and i thought i could automate this. The idea is to compare the current top 10 companies for each fund we like to the previous top 10 last week and to tell me the changes.
This project is very specific to the task, it cannot be easily changed into scraping another file

## Finalised for 13/01/22
The current data is test data which has worked correctly
I will continue to test this every week
